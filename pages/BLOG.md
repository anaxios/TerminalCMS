### Not Very Useful
Dec 19, 2017:

This website project has been a fun learning experience. I'm calling it TerminalCMS. It's just too bad it's not very useful.
I think I'm going to stick with it though. maybe, I'll try to make a game or something. 

Also, I'm not sure how I'm going to deal with images. I don't want it to be limited to text only and ASCII art, 
but I don't think a normal image will fit the asthetic. maybe there's a browser based image auto down-res thing 
I can use to help?

### Idea comes to life

I had the stupid idea for this site looking like an old Apple iie terminal and somehow I got it to work.
It's definitely not 100%, but it's getting there. I have no clue how to get the mobile version to work.
I've only been learning javascript a couple days now. I never realized how powerful it is.

 

### Javascript is ugly

I'm learning javascript after just spending a few months learning C++ 
and I have to say that javascript is not pretty. Callback functions make me want to poke my eyes out.
