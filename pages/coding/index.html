What would be a good way to approximate a pipe opperator in Javascript. I want to be able to chain functions like in Ocaml like "func1 |> func2 |> func3"

## Continue

Here's a simple way to approximate a pipe operator in JavaScript using array's reduce method:

```javascript
function pipe(input, ...fns) {
  return fns.reduce((acc, fn) => fn(acc), input);
}

// usage
const result = pipe(5, 
  x => x * 2, 
  x => x + 3, 
  x => x / 2
);
console.log(result);  // Output: 7
```

In this example, `pipe` function takes an initial value and an array of functions to be executed in sequence. The `reduce` function applies each function in turn to the accumulated value (starting with the initial value).

Note: This approach is left-to-right execution (like `func1 |> func2 |> func3`), meaning it's more like a pipe operator in F# or Elixir rather than in OCaml (which is right-to-left). 

For right-to-left execution (like in OCaml), you can simply reverse the function array:

```javascript
function pipe(input, ...fns) {
  return fns.reverse().reduce((acc, fn) => fn(acc), input);
}
```

Also, if you're using a more modern JavaScript environment or transpiler that supports the pipeline operator proposal, you might be able to use the actual pipeline operator `|>`:

```javascript
let result = 5
  |> (x => x * 2)
  |> (x => x + 3)
  |> (x => x / 2);

console.log(result);  // Output: 7
```

However, as of now, this feature is still at stage 1 proposal and not yet widely supported in JavaScript environments.

is the pipline operator supported in node?

## Continue

As of my knowledge up to date (March 2022), the pipeline operator `|>` is not yet supported in Node.js without using a transpiler like Babel, since it's still at a proposal stage (Stage 1) in the JavaScript specification process.

If you want to use it in Node.js, you would need to use a transpiler like Babel to transform your code into a version of JavaScript that Node.js understands.

Here's how you can set it up with Babel:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev @babel/cli @babel/preset-env @babel/plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator
    ```

2. Create a `.babelrc` file with the following content:

    ```json
    {
      "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"],
      "plugins": [
        ["@babel/plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator", { "proposal": "minimal" }]
      ]
    }
    ```

3. Now you can use Babel to transpile your code:

    ```bash
    npx babel src --out-dir dist
    ```

Replace `src` with the path to your source code and `dist` with the path where you want the transpiled code to be output.

Please note that the setup could change as the proposal advances through the stages, and the support might be added in future versions of Node.js. Always refer to the latest documentation for the most accurate information.

is the pipline operator supported in typescript?

## Continue

As of my knowledge up to date (March 2022), the pipeline operator `|>` is not yet supported in TypeScript. 

The pipeline operator is still at a proposal stage (Stage 1) in the JavaScript specification process. TypeScript generally waits for proposals to reach Stage 3 before implementing them, to ensure stability and compatibility with the final version of the feature.

However, you can use a workaround in TypeScript using a function to mimic the pipeline operator, similar to what we discussed in JavaScript:

```typescript
function pipe<T>(value: T, ...functions: Array<(arg: T) => T>): T {
  return functions.reduce((currentValue, currentFunction) => currentFunction(currentValue), value);
}

// usage
let result = pipe(5, 
  x => x * 2, 
  x => x + 3, 
  x => x / 2
);
console.log(result);  // Output: 7
```

This `pipe` function takes an initial value and an array of functions to be executed in sequence. The `reduce` function applies each function in turn to the accumulated value (starting with the initial value).
